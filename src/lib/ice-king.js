    `Heh? Stop meddling, boy! You and your magical dog can't harm me.`,
    `I'm going to make one marry me!`,
    `Your hat is stupid!`,
    `Now I've got you, boy!`,
    `Fool! Your powers are no match for my magical crown!`,
    `My powers! Foul and noisome whelp! You've not seen the last of my wintery fangs! I'll cleave the warmth from your bones and stop still your beating heart with my claaaaws...`

    `Do you know what 'Ice King' means?!`,
    `Ladies! I brought you a baby, and a puppy!`,
    `I'll show you fun. Fun is my middle name!`,
    `Play it or I'll squish you into juice!`,
    `I am the king! I am the king of c-c-cool!`,
    `Ooh, are you trying to hit me? Well, excuse me because I have to go potty in the bathroom.`,
    `Who are you? Ha ha ha! I know, you're probably a... a biiiiiiig neeeerd! Hey baby, why don't you try being cool like me?`,
    `This is my domain!`,
    `Fat! Fat! Fat! Daddy's little fatty. Oh, you'll never get a prom date with all that tub on your face, you know?`,
    `Finn? Ugh! Why can't you ever be a princess?`,
    `Finish him off, my semi-loyal pet!`,
    `Now finally I can kill you! Oh, wait. Wait, wait... I am so stupid. Silly billy. I came by to tell you the good news. I'm getting married to someone who wants to marry me."`,
    `Strangling the groom's nose at a wedding?! What's wrong with you?!`

    `Gunter, who told you you could fly?`,
    `No one sucks the life from my penguins except me... and maybe polar bears, because that's just nature, Gunter.`,
    `You've raised my frosty dander!`,
    `I've soiled my tunic, completely by choice!`,
    `Finn! You have destroyed my faith in canned peanut brittle!`,
    `These bars won't hold me forever! Hey, there's only like two of them.`,
    `I'm toying with you... psychologically!`,
    `Ha ha ha ha ha! I'm rockin' your world view!`,
    `So, let me get this straight. You're hitting on me.`,
    `I'm a banana!!`,
    `Oh, well... Gunter, dispose of Finn's carcass.`,
    `Gunter, you're embarrassing me!`,
    `Gunter was preggers!`,
    `Oh. I... I see. It's all making sense now. Brrrrapapo! (Blasts window with ice magic, shattering it) I'm going, Princess. I'm sorry if my skin grossed you out. Nobody wants to see this old skin, I guess. (Tearing up) Nobody in the world.`,
    `Hey. I had to keep an eye on the Princess because she's being possessed by the Lich.`,
    `Because when you have stanky old Wizard Eyes, sometimes you see things that are real, and other times it's like crazy, crazy, crazy, in your face, all the time. (sighs) All the time.`,
    `Okay, I didn't kill her this time. Everybody saw that, right?`

    `Whoa! You are fast... and quiet... and very good at dramatic silence. I like it.`,
    `No! Come back, you wussy!`,
    `Look, a supermodel! Look, a hoverboard! Look, the apocalypse! Someone got hit in the boingloings! Hit in the boingloings! Boingloings! Boingloings! Somebody got hit in them. Peace out!`,
    `I take artful black-and-white photographs of my penguin's body parts.`,
    `How 'bout me? Put me on the grid, scale of 1 to 10. 1 is "totally gross," 10 is like, "Hey, Ice King. You look crazy siiiiick!"`,
    `(reading his Fionna & Cake fan-fiction) 'Ice King is the hottest hottie, and I can't wait to marry him!' said Fionna. Then, she turned to Prince Gumball and said, 'I hope Ice King will sweep me off my feet and take me to the farthest corner of Ooo, where we will do nothing but kiss and eat a whole bunch, until we get fat and die.' The end.`,
    `Iniceable Vincearmor...`,
    `(As Simon Petrikov) After purchasing this crown from an old dock worker in Northern Scandinavia, I brought it home and excitedly showed my fiance, Betty. I jokingly put it on my head just for a laugh or something. And that's when it started... the visions. I fought with them, shouted at them until I realized it wasn't real, it was the crown! I quickly took it off, and saw my fiancee in front of me, looking at me with such contempt! What had I said? What had I done when I wore this crown? All I know is, I never saw Betty again.`,
    `(As Simon Petrikov) I know my mind is changing... but I'm already gone too far to know what to do. I want people to know that... if I do things that... if I do things that hurt anyone, please, please forgive me.`,
    `(As Simon Petrikov) Just watch over me until I can find my way out of this labyrinth in my brain and regain my sanity. And then maybe Betty, my princess... maybe you will love me again. Please love me again, Betty!`,
    `Now you know my secret! You know... that I used to wear glasses!`

    `Gunter, are you blowin' it up in here? You are nasty, Gunter. You got a nasty booty, mister. Nasty!`,
    `Sorry. I thought you had a stank booty, Gunter. My bad.`,
    `Trust me! We are turbros! Turbo bros! Tur... bros... turbo... bros.`,
    `"What do you think, Finn? Can we pull back the veil of static and reach in to the source of all being? Behind this curtain of patterns, this random pattern generator. So clever. Right here in every home, watching us from a one-sided mirror."`,
    `Wizards only, fools, keep it tight.`,
    `J. T. Dawgzone always says, 'Ladies are drawn to bros. with tortured pasts.' And I've got a way tortured past! I think. I don't really . . . re . . . hmm.`,
    `I just wanted to be loved!`

    `Huh? Oh. Now where were we? To free yourself from this tomb, and never more re-enter, find the room amidst the rooms that lies exactly center?`,
    `Ah! Alright! I knocked you out and brought you here! I'm sorry, but I had to do it. Each of you possess the exact qualities to pass the various tests of this dungeon. Tree Trunks, with your baking skills! Lemongrab, with your lemon-y juice! Yeah... Shelby, who should have been the bait for the fish. And BMO, who should of been here instead of this weird piece of junk that I don't remember nothing about. Ah, but I've failed!`,
    `Now you see why I need to bring you here. Behold the Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving! [...] Anything goes in the Magi's ice flames comes to life! Anything at all! [...] Yes! isn't it amazing? [...] Don't be sad, because I've brought the ultimate thing! This! [...] Except it's not my journal! It's my Fionna and Cake fan fiction! All my brilliant fantasies will now be real! Fionna, Cake, Marshall Lee, will all be living breathing beings just like me!`,
    `I know you are out there somewhere. I just haven't figured out how to get to you. But believe me, I will. I will.`,
    `I love you too . . . Gunter.`,
    `This island doesn't have a lady, this island is a lady!`,
    `Yeah, well PB is just so closed off to her emotions. She crushes the relationship so she doesn't even have to develop feelings.`,
    `Banana Guards yourself, Princess!`,
    `Oh, hey, kids! Fine day for a picnic.`
